# Beef to Bacteria

# Overview 

In the module we were tasked with helping one of our research scienctist display her finds in a user friendly way. She thankfully took some notes and recommendations from her data science friends and stored her data in a JSON file. From the JSON file, we were able to create an interactive drop down menu and respective graphs that changed when IDs were changed. This allowed the user quick access to view the progress of each bacteria. Below is a screenshot of the final dashboard.

From the bare bones dashboard, we added 3 styles to it. The first was an image behind the jumpo text title. Additionally, we changed the text color to white. Finally, we changed the containers to container-fluid to help with mobile phone or tablet viewing.

# Summary 

This project was a very useful project to learn Java script and the creation of an interactive dashboard.
